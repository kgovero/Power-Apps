Power Farkle is a dice game built with Power Apps. It is built with the mobile layout.

I was inspired by other Power App makers to create a game in Power Apps so I set out to make a dice game.

<b>Features:</b>

This app was a great way to learn some concepts in Power Apps like:

- Using Named Formulas feature (App > Formulas)
- Working with collections and galleries
- Using timers for animation
- Adding configurable score settings
- Power Fx Formulas

<b>Here's some ideas of what you can do next ... What other ideas can you think of? </b>
<li>
Implement tracking achievements (e.g., scoring over 1000/2000/etc in a single roll, scoring > 11k in one game, winning by more than double the score of another player)
Restyle the app/design to be more responsive
Enhance the dice roll animation to make it more realistic/stable
Ability to play against computer
Add more settings
</li>

<b>Using the sample:</b>

No configuration is needed to use this sample.  All data are stored locally in the app.

Download the .msapp and open using "..." > Open within the Power Apps Studio.

Note: The animations may not display correctly in the Studio Editor  For the timer/animations to work properly, Publish and Play the app.
